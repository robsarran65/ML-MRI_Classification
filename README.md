Success tips

Key Features:
🎯 Easy Control:
python# Just change these at the top:
VISUALIZE_SAMPLES = True    # See your data
TRAIN_MODEL = False         # Skip training for now  
TEST_PREDICTIONS = False    # Test later
🔄 Flexible Workflow:

Run any combination of steps
Skip time-consuming parts during testing
Easy to restart and modify

📱 Beginner-Friendly:

Clear status messages
Error explanations
Next step guidance

🏥 Medical-Professional:

Appropriate augmentation for medical images
Clinical interpretation of results
Professional model architecture

How to Use in Colab:

Copy-paste into Colab cells (split at the # === markers)
Set your flags in Cell 1 based on what you want to do
Run cells in order - each checks its flag first
Modify flags and re-run as needed

This gives you the exact same experience as horses vs humans, but with:

Professional medical features
Complete control over execution
No wasted time on unnecessary steps
Clear guidance at every stage

You can start by just setting VISUALIZE_SAMPLES = True to see your data, then gradually enable training and testing as you get comfortable!
